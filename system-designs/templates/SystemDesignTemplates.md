Template for Scalable System Design

1️⃣ Step 1: Problem Understanding

Clearly define the use case

Identify the system type:

Read-heavy vs. Write-heavy

Real-time vs. Batch Processing

Monolithic vs. Microservices

2️⃣ Step 2: Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

Functional Requirements (FRs)

Define core functionalities users expect.

List API endpoints if needed.

Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

High Availability

Scalability

Latency Requirements

Data Consistency Model (Strong vs. Eventual Consistency)

3️⃣ Step 3: Traffic Estimation

Monthly Active Users (MAU)

Daily Active Users (DAU)

Read-to-Write Ratio

Requests per Second (RPS) Calculation

4️⃣ Step 4: Database Schema & Storage

Define key tables, attributes, and relationships.

Decide between SQL vs. NoSQL.

Storage estimates.

5️⃣ Step 5: Backend Server Estimation

Requests per Second (RPS) Breakdown.

Server specification and estimation.

6️⃣ Step 6: High-Level Architecture

Component

Technology

Load Balancer

Nginx, HAProxy

Backend API

Node.js, Spring Boot

Database

PostgreSQL, DynamoDB

Caching

Redis, Memcached

Messaging Queue

7️⃣ Step 7: Scalability & Optimization

Caching Mechanisms

Horizontal Scaling Strategy

Sharding & Partitioning

8️⃣ Step 8: Trade-offs & Challenges

Trade-off

Explanation

Consistency vs. Performance

Eventual consistency for faster reads

Storage Cost vs. Query Speed

Indexed vs. Non-indexed fields

Template for Stream and Batch Systems

1️⃣ Step 1: Problem Understanding

Is it Batch or Streaming?

Expected Data Volume per second/day.

Real-time or Near real-time processing?

2️⃣ Step 2: Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

Functional Requirements (FRs)

Data ingestion

Processing and aggregation logic

Querying and analytics

Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

Low latency requirements

Fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms

3️⃣ Step 3: Data Volume & Processing Estimation

Metric

Estimation

Daily Data Volume

TBs/PBs

Events per Second

100K - 500K

4️⃣ Step 4: Processing Framework Choice

System Type

Technology Stack

128GB RAM

10

Flink Processing

200K RPS

256GB RAM

20

6️⃣ Step 6: High-Level Architecture

Component

Technology

Data Ingestion

Kafka, AWS S3

Stream Processing

Flink, Kafka Streams

Indexing for Fast Querying

8️⃣ Step 8: Trade-offs & Challenges

Trade-off

Explanation

Throughput vs. Latency

Higher throughput may cause event lag

Cost vs. Performance

More resources reduce processing time
