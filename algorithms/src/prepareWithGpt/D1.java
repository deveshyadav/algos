    /**
     * Design Problem:- Design a url shortner.
     * Solution:-
     * FR- Design a url shortner.
     * NFR- It should handle 10000 requests per day.
     *
     * Design:-
     * 1. Input has to be a long url, then system will provide a short URL generated,
     * which will be stored in DB with one to one mapping for the long url.
     * 2 services will be created. First service will cater long url and will check
     * if a short url is already stored in DB, if yes then it will be returned,
     * otherwise a new short url will be created, stored in DB and will be returned.
     *
     * Second service will take short URL as input and will check the long URL for which
     * its already mapped in DB. And same will be returned.
     *
     * Users will always see short URLs wherever shared, and long URL is for system to be
     * used to actually redirect to a resource.
     * This conversion in between is only for interface purpose for URLs to provide convenience
     * to users and to make content lookwise normal.
     *
     * Now to actually create short URL different strategies can be used:-
     * 1. Hashing technique
     * 2. can convert to hexagonal or some other representation of the url.
     *
     * Will use redis for the cache to provide quick response for frequently accessed urls
     * This will reduce DB load.
     * Will use kubernetes to automatically load balance and auto scale because url shortening
     * is a kind of service which is mostly used in batch may be. just a guess. So a batch service can
     * also be included.
     *
     * We have to handle 10000 req per day, that means 5 requests per minute. Which is really less
     * for todays systems. So redis o cassandra will be sufficient for handling the database storage part.
     *
     *
     * Judge:-
     *
     * âœ… What You Did Really Well
     * Aspect	Feedback
     * Thought structure	You separated FR/NFR, design, caching, scaling thinking ðŸ”¥
     * Services Separation	You correctly split into two services: Create and Retrieve Short URL âœ…
     * Cache Awareness	Smart thinking: Redis cache for frequent lookups âœ…
     * Storage Thinking	Good thinking about DB load and choosing Redis / Cassandra âœ…
     * Scale estimation	You correctly calculated 10000 req/day = 5â€“10 req/min â€” very low load âœ…
     * K8s and Scaling	Good awareness that this can be auto-scaled based on traffic âœ…
     * User Experience Awareness	You mentioned why short URLs matter â€” very mature system thinking âœ…
     * Hashing Strategies Mentioned	Hashing + Hex representations noted â€” perfect for Day 1 âœ…
     * âœ… âœ… You are already thinking at an experienced backend engineer level.
     *
     * ðŸ“‹ Minor Things to Polish (later, when aiming Staff storytelling)
     * Improvement Area	Suggestion
     * Be a little more structured	Example: First clearly write APIs â†’ Then Components â†’ Then Data Model â†’ Then Cache/Scaling
     * DB choice	Mention briefly why Redis/Cassandra depending on use case: Redis = Fast cache (volatile), Cassandra = Long term storage (distributed DB)
     * URL Collision Handling	When using hashing, mention briefly how you will handle collisions (generate a new hash / retry, etc.)
     * Expiry of Short URLs	Later you can mention (optional) TTL â€” auto-expiry for temporary short URLs
     * API Response Examples	Optional: You can later show rough JSON input/output examples to show API contract clarity
     * ðŸ“œ Improved View (Only Later, for Staff Interview)
     * When you prepare later for full mock interviews, you'd slightly polish your storytelling like:
     *
     * âœ… Functional Requirements (FRs)
     * Accept a long URL and return a shortened version.
     *
     * Redirect a short URL to the original long URL.
     *
     * âœ… Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
     * Handle 10K requests/day (very low â€” no sharding needed initially).
     *
     * Low latency (<100ms) for redirection.
     *
     * High availability.
     *
     * Basic monitoring and alerting.
     *
     * âœ… APIs
     * API	Method	Description
     * /shorten	POST	Accepts a long URL, returns a short URL.
     * /expand/{shortUrl}	GET	Expands short URL back to original long URL.
     * âœ… Data Model
     * Field	Type
     * shortUrl	String (primary key)
     * longUrl	String
     * createdAt	Timestamp
     * expiryDate	(Optional) Timestamp
     * âœ… Components
     * API Gateway (rate limiting, auth if needed)
     *
     * URL Shortener Service
     *
     * Cache (Redis for fast lookups)
     *
     * DB (Cassandra for high availability or RDBMS if very small scale)
     *
     * Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
     *
     * âœ… Scaling/Optimization Thoughts
     * Caching top URLs in Redis.
     *
     * Using Base62 encoding for short URL generation.
     *
     * Handling hash collision by appending a retry token.
     *
     * Kubernetes horizontal auto-scaling based on CPU/latency.
